An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.\n\nThe target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target\u0027s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell\u0027s range.\n\nWhen the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.","duration":"Concentration, up to 10 minutes.","higherLevels":"","isCustom":false,"isRitual":false,"jsonType":"spell","level":2,"name":"Levitate","notes":"","pinned":false,"prepared":false,"range":"60 feet","school":"transmutation","type":"2nd-level transmutation"},{"castingTime":"1 action","classes":"artificer, artificer__eb_, artificer__revised_, sorcerer, fighter, rogue, wizard","components":"V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)","description":"You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the Duration.
